#Battle 
The ambush of the dead is a battle during the [[Great Pirate Arc]]. This was a difficult battle against skeleton.

## Context
After killing a pirate who was rowing for his life, the [[Party]] decided to rest at the second tower (after clearing it of coarse). 

Although once we arrive, we notice that it is desolate with a bunch of inanimate elf skeletons. [[Eldarion]] is distraught by this (Thinking this is part of his [[Eldarion#Known Backstory|backstory]]) and starts investigating on this matter.

After like a day and a half of investigating, they find a hidden trapdoor, opening it leads to nothing but a rune puzzle where we need to know a specific language to solve. After finding this trapdoor though. We get ambushed, thus starting the battle.

Upon post battle we learn that the whole skeleton thing was mostly just decoration to scare the [[Party]] away, made and sourced from the [[Cobolt Prisoner]] who was hidden in the rune basement.

## Location

## Participants
- [[Eldarion]]
- [[Lanimok]]

# Transcript
**Note: I was playing in this combat over discord so i don't have all the details, i need confirmation from another player who was present during the fight to confirm this transcript**
#### Part 1
The battle starts by us getting surprised so we can't do anything for a round.
The skeletons do decent damage.

We finally get to move so we start attacking. During our attacks, we learn that slicing is not very effective on them and that they don't need spines to stand... We learned that the hard way.

We later realise we can just hit them very hard and start doing that.

This part ends when the skeleton minotaur and the orc show up from the ocean.

#### Part 2
The minotaur shows up from the ocean and starts slicing us, dealing enough damage to [[Runn night]] for him to run away like a chicken.

The rest of the [[Party]] clean up the battlefield while [[Runn night]] cowers.


## Conclusion
- We cleared the watchtower
- We most likely the rune puzzle trap so we can just brute-force it.
- We capture the [[Cobolt Prisoner]]
