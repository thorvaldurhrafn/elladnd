#Battle 
The ride of the seven seas is a battle where a bunch of pirates are raining down arrows on [[Lanimok]], [[Oculus]], [[Runn night]] and [[Rerecros]]. This battle was during the [[Great Pirate Arc]]

## Context
This battle is a continuation of the [[The night of the slow fallers|previous battle]] but long story short.

[[Eldarion]] is up alone in a lighthouse and [[Rerecros]], [[Runn night]] and [[Oculus]] are boating to another tower.

Now some extra information that was not written in the [[The night of the slow fallers|previous battle]].

The three of them are actually sailing with two boats. For some reason, I'm not sure what [[Ãžorvaldur]] was thinking with that one.

## Location
[[Pirate Base]] at sea and a watchtower

## Participants
- [[Eldarion]]
- [[Oculus]]
- [[Lanimok]]
- [[Runn night]]
- [[Rerecros]]
- 2 Towers full of pirates.
