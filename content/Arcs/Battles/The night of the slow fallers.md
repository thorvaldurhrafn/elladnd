#Battle 
The night of the slow fallers is a battle at a watchtower near the [[Pirate Base]].

This battle was for the purpose of capturing a watchtower to gain more control of the base.

This battle was during the [[Great Pirate Arc]]

## Context
[[Party|The Party]] were still on an adventure to save [[Jósef]] from [[Nautsteinn]] and they have approached the first tower. The [[Pirate Navigator]] claims that the [[Pirate Base]] is one big raft with a huge circle of watchtowers.

# Transcript
#### Part 1
[[Dimentia]] casts Feather Fall on [[Runn night]], [[Rerecros]] and [[Eldarion]] so they can throw themselves upward like 200 ft. 
[[Eldarion]] throws [[Runn night]] upwards and [[Rerecros]] and [[Eldarion]] shoot themselves out of a giant crossbow.
Meanwhile, [[Lanimok]] is taking his new demon [[Oculus]] onto a boat to the lighthouse.
Oculus is the one rowing the boat (Very slowly) while Lanimok is hiding in his ink bottle.

[[Runn night]] night struggles to move himself as he is slow falling in the air while Eldarion is not struggling with moving but is under fire by two pirates on the tower.
[[Rerecros]] is just having the time of his life with feather falling.

This part ends after feather falling runs out. [[Runn night]] couldn't position himself in the air so he floats over the tower and falls in the ocean, taking some fall damage. [[Eldarion]] does fine as he makes it on to the tower and in mid-air, smites the two pirates, exploding them instantly.

#### Part 2
[[Runn night]] fell 200 ft into the ocean so he needs to get rescued. It´s a good thing [[Oculus]] and was around to pick him up from the ocean.


[[Runn night]] and [[Oculus]] decide to retrieve [[Rerecros]] from where ever he is after he fell off the roof of the tower while [[Eldarion]] is just relaxing on top of the tower([[Frosti]] had to leave so now he was forced to play through Discord).

This part ends when [[Rerecros]] is retrieved and the three decide to ditch [[Eldarion]] and sail to another tower.

#### Part 3
[[Eldarion]] is now alone on the tower as three pirates advance up the tower in hopes of taking [[Eldarion]] down. [[Eldarion]] takes them down without a scratch.

Battle ends
