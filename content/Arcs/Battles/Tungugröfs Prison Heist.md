# Transcript
#### Part 1
The heist starts with [[Lanimok]] stealthily climbing up to a window on the second story during the night and then help [[Calcula]] and [[Runn Night]] enter the building, during this part we searched the building for possibly any objects that could be of use, we found a book of law that we thought would be a good idea to give [[Rerecros]] so he could actually study law but our investigation halts when we locate two guards.
#### Part 2
[[Lanimok]] uses a sheet and some "magic" to summon a fake ghost to scare the guards away, but that makes the guards just call in more guards, while the two guards explain to the other guards what happened, we hid in a room until the extra guards went back to sleep, this whole encounter spooked the guards so when [[Lanimok]] summoned the ghost again, the guards just ran straight to the ghosts, making our plan to lure them to us work and we silence them(non lethally).
#### Part 4
We steal some stuff, explore the lower part of the building, steal some more stuff and we finally make our way to the basement prison cell, we knock out a prison watcher, steal his key and then [[Party|the party]] all leave with some treasure.
## Conclusion
- [[Eldarion]] and [[Rerecros]] are now free.
- [[Eldarion]] and [[Rerecros]] are now wanted fugitives in [[Tungugröf]].
- [[Party|The party]] quickly decide to leave.
