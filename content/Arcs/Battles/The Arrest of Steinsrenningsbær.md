#### Part 2
Thanks to a smite by [[Eldarion]], the rest of [[Party|the party]] is alerted of the commotion and they go see what's going on, [[Rerecros|Rerecros's]] first instinct was to cause [[Eldarion]] to grow twice his size so he can take the guards on while [[Runn Night|Runn night's]] first instinct was to get [[Gnall]] and [[Rerecros]] to de-escalate the situation so no-body would get hurt. But this eventually escalates to [[Rerecros]] shooting a guard with a chaos bolt, making him *explode*.
#### Part 3
Due to a second commotion, implied to be made from the god [[Eldarion]] worships: [[Imperia]], a large number of guards leave the battle, making [[Eldarion]] and [[Rerecros]] able to take out the rest of the guards, shortly after that, more guards show up and manage to arrest [[Rerecros]] and have [[Eldarion]] co-operate in their arrest.
