## Character backstory
During the [[Great Pirate Arc]], the party stumbled across a watchtower with dead remains of elves. This concerned Eldarion because he made a connection between the dead skeletons and his dead mother. 
After the [[Great Pirate Arc]], we made a pit stop to [[Eldarion]]'s home island. *I was on discord at that duration so I have no idea what extra lore he dropped during that session*
Which tells us that Eldarion's mother is dead, [[Frosti]] himself also stated that his mother is a human.
With that said. We know that his mother is a human and that he lived on an island once

## Story thus far
### The beginning
During the first few sessions, Eldarion's first "mission" was during [[The Fight Of No Risks]] where he captured someone named [[Gnall]] and freed his home, [[Nautey]] from [[Nýja Veldið]]'s wrath. During this phase, he has had a unique dynamic between him and [[Lanimok]]. [[Lanimok]] is a fan of chaotic hijinks but Eldarion is a fan of control, this dynamic eventually led up to [[Lanimok]] lose his guard, enabling Eldarion to kidnap [[Lanimok]] and do "unspeakable things" to him.
### Pirate adventure
A few weeks after [[Eldarion#The beginning|the beginning]], Eldarion and the party were assigned to travel with a ship in case of pirates attacking us. Eldarion has not developed much but during the inevitable [[The pirate siege]], Eldarion was pierced which consequently, knocked Eldarion out. After the siege, the [[Party]] decided to raid the pirates, now in the duration of the trip, Eldarion didn't really do much, but when we arrived, he did a lot.

When we reached the [[Pirate Base]], [[Party|the party's]] first course of action was to abuse feather fall during the [[The night of the slow fallers]], during that battle, Eldarion launched himself into the air and smited two pirates relaxing on their tower, she then shortly got onto the tower and smited 2 more pirates. He spared one pirate and used him to row him on a boat so he could partake in [[The Ride of the Seven Seas]]. Those events were intense for Eldarion but the next events would not be as intimidating.

[[Party|The party]] infiltrated the [[Pirate Base]] to rescue a specific prisoner, during that infiltration, he befriended a [[Cobolt Pirate]], too bad he had to leave him after escaping the base.
### Tungugröf
Nothing else happened in the meantime but later at [[Tungugröf]], Eldarion started a fight while talking about politics and slavery to a guard. This battle ended with Eldarion and [[Rerecros]] getting arrested. He was swiftly released though only for him to become a wanted fugitive in [[Tungugröf]]. Since he and [[Rerecros]] are wanted in [[Tungugröf]], [[Party|the party]] decide to leave, during our departure we get interrupted by a guard, which Eldarion responded by threatening him.
