## Appearance
Lanimok looks like a "young dark elf" with brown eyes and dark messy hair. He sports a hoodie.
## Character backstory
Lanimok has already revealed some good information about his backstory. 
We know he lived in a very dark place where magic is not common. Lanimok wanted to learn magic so he obviously did the only reasonable thing and left his home to learn magic. He failed at learning magic over the years because of the fact that he did not know much magic. Now he is with us in [[The Rebellion]]. This was all revealed when he got called out for stealing a peace of plate mail.
## Equipment and Loadout
- **[[Lanimoks ink bottle|Ink bottle]]**, a mysterious ink bottle which grants him the power to jump inside the bottle and store stuff in it. Rumoured to only work once per long rest.
- **Molotov's**, The crafty elf has access to home-made Molotovs which he can use to burn stuff down.
- **Spell tome**, Lanimok is a wizard so he needs his spell tome to cast spells.
- [[Glasses of Blurriness]], a pair of glasses that gives the holder the ability to become slightly harder to *see*, grants a +2 to stealth when it comes to being seen.
## Abilities
- **Inky powers**. Lanimok is able to shrink himself into ink bottles and store items in it. He claims that there are limits as he cannot put in large items or sentient beings.
- **Magic**. Lanimok is a wizard so he knows how to cast spells due to that.
- **Fantastic Swimming** Lanimok went through a ton of effort to learn how to swim fast. He swims really fast 

## Relationships
- **[[Oculus]]** Oculus seems to think very highly of Lanimok as Lanimok is his master, but this might be a one-way street. As he is not that concerned about Oculus losing two of his limbs.
- **[[Eldarion]]**. Eldarion and Lanimok's relationship is a little toxic. The reason they got a notable relationship is because Lanimok likes playing things dangerously and Eldarion likes capturing people, Eldarion captures Lanimok once, does some thing that only [[Frosti]] and [[Steinn]] know about and now Lanimok has become dependant on Eldarion and is repeatably asking Eldarion for money. This could be an example of [[Stockholm Syndrome]].
## Notable quotes
- "Boom?"
- "Stans stans stans, nú er tími fyrir dans dans dans"
## Story thus far

### The beginning
Lanimok from the start has been the best at surprising us, thanks to his vast amount of magic and his inventory which we don't have access to, he is always able to come up with a surprising tactic which always makes us go "WHAT?". This can be greatly described in the beginning of the session where we learn about Lanimok's ink bottle for the first time, during the [[The Fight Of No Risks]], Lanimok jumps out of his ink bottle to attack the enemies.
After the battle, Lanimok falls unconscious, not for being attacked, but ingesting random herbs, this gives [[Eldarion]] the opportunity to capture Lanimok to gain control of this wizard of chaos. [[Eldarion]]'s plan goes perfectly and Lanimok is under his control.
### Pirate adventure
During [[Great Pirate Arc|the Great Pirate Arc]], Lanimok bought a demon called [[Oculus]]. [[Oculus]] was the cheapest demon there
Lanimok had a lot of shocking moments during [[Great Pirate Arc|the Great Pirate Arc]] where he has Burned down a ship and killing tens of pirates and attempted an assassination of a more popular person using magic fog. 
### Tungugröf
After the pirate adventure, [[Party|the party]] decided to visit [[Tungugröf]] while on their way to [[Gamla veldið]], but during [[Tungugröf]], [[Eldarion]] and [[Rerecros]] got themselves arrested, this of course forced Lanimok, [[Runn night]] and [[Calcula]] to work together to break them out of prison, Lanimok bought the [[Glasses of Blurriness]] which helped Lanimok with saving [[Eldarion]] and [[Rerecros]] a whole lot. After we saved [[Rerecros]] and [[Eldarion]], [[Party|the party]] decided to leave the town and continue our adventure to [[Gamla veldið]].
