## Appearance
He has long dark hair, 
## Character backstory
[[Benni]] wrote in the discord server about his backstory:

[[Lanimok]] adopted him 
Since my parents disappeared. And he found me in a forest where my wild magic was awakened.
So we now know his origin story but there are still a few things missing and I hope we learn more **during** dnd and not just in discord.
## Equipment and Loadout
- Book of magic items
- Wand, Rerecros's wand is his spellcasting focus
- **[[Charaltans dice]]**, a set of dice that lands on any number the holder chooses.
## Abilities
- **Magic**. Rerecros is a sorcerer so he knows magic.
- **Wild magic** Rerecros has access to a powerful surge of unpredictable magic
- **Sorcery points** he can use sorcery points

## Relationships
- [[Eldarion]], Rerecros has been employed by Eldarion as his lawyer. Their chemistry is strange as Rerecros just asks Eldarion for money, and Eldarion is clearly not happy with his lawyer as during [[The pirate siege]], Rerecros got stabbed to near death and Eldarion made it clear that he did not care at all.
- [[Lanimok]] Lanimok canonically adopted Rerecros, so I guess that Rerecros sees him as a parental figure.
## Notable quotes
- "Það var ekki viljandi"
- "With your help, we can change this"
## Story thus far
### The beginning
In the early beginning of the campaign, Rerecros became [[Eldarion|Eldarion's]] lawyer, and he used his *lawyerly* prowess to win over [[Nautey|Nautey's]] popularity and make them regain [[Eldarion|Eldarion's]] trust.
### Pirate Adventure
During [[Great Pirate Arc|the Great Pirate Arc]], Rerecros was stabbed by a common pirate and his employer [[Eldarion]] did not care in the slightest as he made clear how replaceable Rerecros was, the Pirate arc was also where we learned of Rerecros's cowardice side as he was ready to give up the [[The Final Haul]] the second things go south.
### Tungugröf
During [[Party|the party's]] visit to [[Tungugröf]], Rerecros bought some [[Charaltans dice]]. [[Eldarion]] also got into a fight with the town's guards and since [[Rerecros]] was his lawyer, he had to de-escalate the situation which he did by blasting a guard with a chaos bolt, killing him immediately, this instantly escalated the situation which eventually concluded in Rerecros and [[Eldarion]] getting arrested. The two of them got broken out of jail though but now they are wanted as outlaws. [[Party|The party]] decide to leave the town because of this.
