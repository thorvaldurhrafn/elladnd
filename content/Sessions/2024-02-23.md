Eldarion og rerecros eru í fangelsi. Runn night og Lanimok eru að nýta daginn og munu bjarga þau um nóttina. Lanimok keypti gleraugu sem gefa +2 í stealth og runn night er að lækka vagn fyrir 5 gull.
Gleraugun heita "Glasses of blurryness"

The heist to rescue Eldarion and Rerecros starts. We start with Lanimok walking up a wall and lowering a rope for Runn night and Calcula to climb up.
Lanimok and Runn night search the building and find some stuff, but we encounter 2 guards on watch duty, Lanimok's plan is to create a fake ghost to spook the guards but they just summoned more guards. The guards cleared up later leaving the 2 previous guards spooked of a ghost, we manage to lure the guards to us and we knock them out, we later investigate the area, eventually finding Eldarion and rerecros's stuff(minus the compoment pouch). We then later find Eldarion and Rerecros and we free them, steal some armor and escape.

The next day, the party learns that Eldarion and Rerecros are now wanted for escaping prison and murder.
