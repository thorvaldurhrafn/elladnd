Huginn is a familiar-like crow in the possession of Eldarion

Huginn cannot speak so he communicates with his master through yes and no questions. Using his beak for the yes and no's.

Huginn was great help during the [[Great Pirate Arc]] since he was able to get reinforcements from [[Gnall]] while the [[Party]] was infiltrating the [[Pirate Base]].
